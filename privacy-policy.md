Space Weather is a mobile application that provides real-time space weather information including geomagnetic storm data, solar flare activity, forecasts, and solar imagery.

## Information We Collect

Space Weather does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app:

- Does not require user registration or login
- Does not collect names, email addresses, or contact information
- Does not access your contacts, photos, or files
- Does not track your location

### Data Stored Locally

The app stores the following data locally on your device only:

- **Cache data**: Space weather information is cached to improve performance and reduce data usage
